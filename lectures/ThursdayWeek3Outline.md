# Week 3 Thursday in Projects & Algorithms - May 2, 2024

## Announcements:
- Don't forget about this week's discussion topics and core assignments!!!  We have FOUR core assignments this week:
    - Solo Project Complete
    - Group Project Proposal
    - Fronts in Singly Linked Lists
    - Display in Singly Linked Lists
- Please verify that we have the correct courses and belts in the emails sent last week!
- Don't forget to submit your Group Project Proposal to the platform, or email us if you haven't given us a proposal yet!
- To pass the course:
    - At least 5 out of 8 discussion topics
    - At least 7 out of 8 core assignments - the needed 7 MUST include ALL 4 project assignments related to your solo and group projects!
    - Working solo project (Weeks 1-2 and early Week 3)
    - Working group project (Weeks 3-4)

## Lecture outline:
- Review of mutable vs. immutable data
- Memoization (NOT memorization):
    - Fibonacci sequence without memoization
    - Fibonacci sequence with memoization
- Pascal's triangle with memoization - https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/description/
- In-order subset challenge from "Recursion To Do 3" (if there's time)

## Useful terms to know:
- Divide and conquer - break up into smaller chunks, then solve each independently (no overlap) - usually a top-to-bottom strategy; calculations are often redone
- Dynamic programming - break up into smaller chunks, but solutions to one chunk will depend on another (overlap) - bottom-to-top strategy if using tabularization (usually iteratively with no recursion) OR top-to-bottom if using memoization (usually with recursion)
- Backtracking - solve as we go (often recursively), going back to eliminate possibilities
- Greedy algorithm - make an optimal choice at each step along the way locally without worrying about anything that comes ahead; won't always give the optimal OVERALL result
